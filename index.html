		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		The general purpose of this demo is to educate developers about PHP's PDO (PHP Data Objects) interface and how to get started using it. <br>In addition, to help developers understand SQL injection and how it can be avoided, this demo looks at using the PHP PDO class to access a database in an interactive web application. <br>By following the included example scenario of SQL injection and how it was addressed with the PDO class, developers should be able to transfer their existing knowledge of using the mysqli_* functions <br>that they may be accustomed to using and begin translating that into new knowledge that will lead them to creating more secure web sites and web applications of their own.
		<br>
		Finally, we take a look at using my custom PDO_MySQL class that aims to help simplify and streamline the process of switching to using prepared statements with the PHP PDO interface.
