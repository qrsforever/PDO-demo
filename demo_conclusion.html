		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			In conclusion you can see that by not validating and sanitizing user input it could lead to serious concequences. The best way to currently combat this problem from both a security and a developer's standpoint is to be using prepared statements whenever possible. Hopefully by the end of this demo you can get an understanding of the concepts of SQL injection and how you can prevent it in your own projects. Also, I hope that this demo is helpful to both new and seasoned PHP coders, web devs, and anyone trying to be more secure with their database interactions on the web.
